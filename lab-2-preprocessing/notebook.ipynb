        "he gives and hoards not, and is free from care, passing ever\n",
        "on to some new work.\n",

        "made war upon thy province? He hath bethought him of\n",

        "and the cunning work of frost! Melkor hath devised heats\n",
        "and fire without restraint, and hath not dried up thy desire\n",

        "of the beauty of the vision and engrossed in the unfolding\n",
        "of the World which came there to being, and their minds\n",
        "were filled with it; for the history was incomplete and the\n",
        "circles of time not full-wrought when the vision was taken\n",
