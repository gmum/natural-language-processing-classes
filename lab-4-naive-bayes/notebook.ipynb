        "\"'In due course the brothers separated, each for his own destination.\n",
        "\"'The first brother traveled on for a week more, and reaching a distant village,\n",
        "sought out a fellow wizard with whom he had a quarrel. Naturally, with the Elder Wand\n",
        "as his weapon, he could not fail to win the duel that followed. Leaving his enemy dead\n",
        "upon the floor the oldest brother proceeded to an inn, where he boasted loudly of the\n",

        "Xenophilius had just described was in the room with them at that very moment.\n",
        "\"Exactly,\" said Xenophilius, as if he had defeated them all in reasoned argument.\n",

        "\"Oh, well, in that case there is endless evidence,\" said Xenophilius. \"The Elder\n",

        "\"Which is that the possessor of the wand must capture it from its previous owner,\n",

        "knows where the Elder Wand lies hidden? The trail goes cold with Arcus and Livius.\n",
        "Who can say which of them really defeated Loxias, and which took the wand? And who\n",
        "can say who may have defeated them? History, alas, does not tell us.\"\n",
        "There was a pause. Finally Hermione asked stiffly, \"Mr. Lovegood, does the\n",
        "Peverell family have anything to do with the Deathly Hallows?\"\n",
        "Xenophilius looked taken aback as something shifted in Harry's memory, but he\n",
        "could not locate it. Peverell. . . he had heard that name before. . .\n",
        "\"But you have been misleading me, young woman!\" said Xenophilius, now sitting\n",
        "up much straighter in his chair and goggling at Hermione. \"I thought you were new to the\n",
        "Hallows Quest! Many of us Questers believe that the Peverells have everything –\n",
        "everything! – to do with the Hallows!\"\n",
        "\"Who are the Peverells?\" asked Ron.\n",
        "\"That was the name on the grave with the mark on it, in Godric's Hollow,\" said\n",
        "Hermione, still watching Xenophilius. \"Ignotus Peverell.\"\n",
        "\"Exactly!\" said Xenophilius, his forefinger raised pedantically. \"The sign of the\n",
        "Death Hallows on Ignotus's grave is conclusive proof!\"\n",
        "\"Of what?\" asked Ron.\n",
        "\"Why, that the three brothers in the story were actually the three Peverell brothers,\n",
        "Antioch, Cadmus and Ignotus! That they were the original owners of the Hallows!\"\n",
        "With another glance at the window he got to his feet, picked up the tray, and\n",
        "headed for the spiral staircase.\n",
        "\"You will stay for dinner?\" he called, as he vanished downstairs again.\n",
        "\"Everybody always requests our recipe for Freshwater Plimply soup.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Probably to show the Poisoning Department at St. Mungo's,\" said Ron under his\n",
        "breath.\n",
        "Harry waited until they could hear Xenophilius moving about in the kitchen\n",
        "downstairs before speaking.\n",
        "\"What do you think?\" he asked Hermione.\n",
        "\"Oh, Harry,\" she said wearily, \"it's a pile of utter rubbish. This can't be what the\n",
        "sign really means. This must just be his weird take on it. What a waste of time.\"\n",
        "\"I s'pose this is the man who brought us Crumple-Horned Snorkacks,\" said Ron.\n",
        "\"You didn't believe it either?\" Harry asked him.\n",
        "\"Nah, that story's just one of those things you tell kids to teach them lessons, isn't\n",
        "it? 'Don't go looking for trouble, don't go pick fights, don't go messing around with stuff\n",
        "that's best left alone! Just keep your head down, mind your own business, and you'll be\n",
        "okay. Come to think of it,\" Ron added, \"maybe that story's why elder wands are supposed\n",
        "to be unlucky.\"\n",
        "\"What are you talking about?\"\n",
        "\"One of those superstitions, isn't it? 'May-born witches will marry Muggles.' 'Jinx\n",
        "by twilight, undone by midnight.' 'Wand of cider, never prosper.' You must have heard\n",
        "them. My mum's full of them.\"\n",
        "\"Harry and I were raised by Muggles,\" Hermione reminded him. \"We were taught\n",
        "different superstitions.\" She sighed deeply as a rather pungent smell drifted up from the\n",
        "kitchen. The one good thing about her exasperation with Xenophilius was that it seemed\n",
        "to have made her forget that she was annoyed at Ron. \"I think you're right,\" she told him.\n",
        "\"It's just a morality tale, it's obvious which gift is best, which one you'd choose –\"\n",
        "The three of them spoke at the same time: Hermione said, \"the Cloak,\" Ron said,\n",
        "\"the wand,\" and Harry said, \"the stone.\"\n",
        "They looked at each other, half surprised, half amused.\n",
        "\"You're supposed to say the Cloak,\" Ron told Hermione, \"but you wouldn't need\n",
        "to be invisible if you had the wand. An unbeatable wand, Hermione, come on!\"\n",
        "\"We've already got an Invisibility Cloak,\" said Harry, \"And it's helped us rather a lot, in\n",
        "case you hadn't noticed!\" said Hermione. \"Whereas the wand would be bound to attract\n",
        "trouble--\"\n",
        "\"Only if you shouted about it,\" argued Ron. \"Only if you were prat enough to go dancing\n",
        "around waving it over your head, and singing, 'I've got an unbeatable want, come and\n",
        "have a go if you think you're hard enough.' As long as you kept your trap shut --\"\n",
        "-Yes, but could you keep your trap shut?\" said Hermione, looking skeptical. \"You know\n",
        "the only true thing he said to us was that there have been stories about extra-powerful\n",
        "wands for hundreds of years.\"\n",
        "\"There have?\" asked Harry.\n",
        "Hermione looked exasperated: The expression was so endearingly familiar that Harry and\n",
        "Ron grinned at each other.\n",
        "\"The Deathstick, the Wand of Destiny, they crop up under different names through the\n",
        "centuries, usually in the possession of some Dark wizard who’s boasting about them.\n",
        "Professor Binns mentioned some of them, but -- oh it's all nonsense. Wands are only as\n",
        "powerful as the wizards who use them. Some wizards just like to boast that theirs are\n",
        "bigger and better than other people's\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"But how do you know,\" said Harry, \"that those wants -- the Deathstick, and the Wand of\n",
        "Destiny -- aren't the same want, surfacing over the centuries under different names?\"\n",
        "\"What if they're all really the Elder Wand, made by Death?\" said Ron.\n",
        "Harry laughed: The strange idea that had occurred to him was after all, ridiculous. His\n",
        "wand, he reminded himself, had been of holly, not elder, and it had been made by\n",
        "Ollivander, whatever it had done that night Voldemort had pursued him across the skies\n",
        "and if it had been unbeatable, how could it have been broken?\n",
        "\"So why would you take the stone?\" Ron asked him.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Well, if you could bring people back, we could have Sirius...Mad-\n",
        "Eye...Dumbledore...my parents...\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Neither Ron nor Hermione smiled.\n",
        "\"But according to Beedle the Bard, they wouldn't want to come back, would they?\" said\n",
        "Harry, thinking about the tail they had just heard. \"I don't suppose there have been loads\n",
        "of other stories about a stone that can raise the dead, have there?: he asked Hermione.\n",
        "\"No,\" she replied sadly. \"I don't think anyone except Mr. Lovegood could kid themselves\n",
        "that's possible. Beedle probably took the idea from the Sorcerer's Stone; you know,\n",
        "instead of a stone to make you immortal, a stone to reverse death.\"\n",
        "The smell from the kitchen was getting stronger. It was something like burning\n",
        "underpants. Harry wondered whether it would be possible to eat enough of whatever\n",
        "Xenophilius was cooking to spare his feelings.\n",
        "\"What about the Cloak, though?\" said Ron slowly. \"Don't you realize, he's right? I've got\n",
        "so used to Harry's Cloak and how good it is, I never stopped to think. I've never heard of\n",
        "one like Harry's. It's infallible. We've never been spotted under it --\"\n",
        "\"Of course not -- we're invisible when we're under it, Ron!\"\n",
        "\"But all the stuff he said about other cloaks, and they're not exactly ten a Knut, you know,\n",
        "is true! It's never occurred to me before but I've heard stuff about charms wearing off\n",
        "cloaks when they get old, or them being ripped apart by spells so they've got holes,\n",
        "Harry's was owned by his dad, so it's not exactly new, is it, but it's just ... perfect!\"\n",
        "\"Yes, all right, but Ron, the stone...\"\n",
        "As they argued in whispers, Harry moved around the room, only half listening. Reaching\n",
        "the spiral stair, he raised his eyes absently to the next level and was distracted at once.\n",
        "His own face was looking back at him from the ceiling of the room above. After a\n",
        "moment's bewilderment, he realized that it was not a mirror, but a painting. Curious, he\n",
        "began to clime the stairs.\n",
        "\"Harry, what are you doing? I don't think you should look around when he's not here!\"\n",
        "But Harry had already reached the next level. Luna had decorated her bedroom ceiling\n",
        "with five beautifully painted faces: Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and Neville. They\n",
        "were not moving as the portraits at Hogwarts moved, but there was a certain magic about\n",
        "them all the same. Harry thought they breathed. What appeared to be a fine golden chains\n",
        "wove around the pictures linking them together, but after examining them for a minute or\n",
        "so, Harry realized that the chains were actually one work repeated a thousand times in\n",
        "golden ink: friends... friends... friends...\n",
        "Harry felt a great rush of affection for Luna. He looked around the room. There was a\n",
        "large photograph beside the bed, of a young Luna and a woman who looked very like her.\n",
        "They were hugging. Luna looked rather better-groomed in this picture than Harry had\n",
        "ever seen her in life. The picture was dusty. This struck Harry as slightly odd. He stared\n",
        "\n",
        "around. Something was wrong. The pale blue carpet was also thick with dust. There were\n",
        "no clothes in the wardrobe, whose doors stood ajar. The bed had a cold, unfriendly look,\n",
        "as though it had not been slept in for weeks. A single cobweb stretched over the nearest\n",
        "window across the blood red sky.\n",
        "\"What's wrong?\" Hermione asked as Harry descended the staircase, but before he could\n",
        "respond, Xenophilius reached the top of the stairs from the kitchen, now holding a tray\n",
        "laden with bowls.\n",
        "\"Mr. Lovegood,\" said Harry. \"Where's Luna?\"\n",
        "\"Excuse me?\"\n",
        "\"Where's Luna?\"\n",
        "Xenophilius halted on the top step.\n",
        "\"I -- I've already told you. She is down at the Botions Bridge fishing for Plimpies.\"\n",
        "\"So why have you only laid that tray for four?\"\n",
        "Xenophilius tried to speak, but no sound came out. The only noise was the continued\n",
        "chugging of the printing press, and a slight rattle from the tray as Xenophilius's hands\n",
        "shook.\n",
        "\"I don't think Luna's been here for weeks.\" said Harry. \"Her clothes are gone, her bed\n",
        "hasn't been slept in. Where is she? and why do you keep looking out of the window?\"\n",
        "Xenophilius dropped the tray. The bowls bounced and smashed Harry, Ron, and\n",
        "Hermione drew their wands. Xenophilius froze his hand about to enter his pocket. At that\n",
        "moment the printing press have a huge bank and numerous Quibblers came streaming\n",
        "across the floor from underneath the tablecloth, the press fell silent at last. Hermione\n",
        "stooped down and picked up one of the magazines, her wand still pointing at Mr.\n",
        "Lovegood.\n",
        "\"Harry, look at this\" He strode over to her as quickly as he could through all the clutter.\n",
        "The front of the Quibbler carried his own picture, emblazoned with the words\n",
        "\"Undesirable Number One\" and captioned with the reward money.\n",
        "\"The Quibbler's going for a new angle, then?: Harry asked coldly, his mind working very\n",
        "fast. \"Is that what you were doing when you went into the garden, Mr. Lovegood?\n",
        "Sending an owl to the Ministry?\n",
        "Xenophilius licked his lips\n",
        "\"They took my Luna,\" he whispered, \"Because of what I've been writing. They took my\n",
        "Luna and I don't know where she is, what they've done to her. But they might give her\n",
        "back to me if I -- If I--\"\n",
        "\"Hand over Harry?\" Hermione finished for him.\n",
        "\"No deal.\" said Ron flatly. \"Get out of the way, we're leaving.\"\n",
        "Xenophilius looked ghastly, a century old, his lips drawn back into a dreadful leer.\n",
        "\"They will be here any moment. I must save Luna. I cannot lose Luna. You must not\n",
        "leave.\"\n",
        "He spread his arms in front of the staircase, and Harry had a sudden vision of his mother\n",
        "doing the same thing in front of his crib.\n",
        "\"Don't make us hurt you,\" Harry said. \"Get out of the way, Mr. Lovegood.\"\n",
        "\"HARRY!\" Hermione screamed.\n",
        "Figures on broomsticks were flying past the windows. As the three of them looked away\n",
        "from him. Xenophilius drew his wand. Harry realized their mistake just in time. He\n",
        "launched himself sideways, shoving Ron and Hermione out of harm's way as\n",
        "\n",
        "Xenophilius's Stunning Spell soared across the room and hit the Erumpent horn.\n",
        "There was a colossal explosion. The sound of it seemed to blow the room apart.\n",
        "Fragments of wood and paper and rubble flew in all directions, along with an\n",
        "impenetrable cloud of thick white dust. Harry flew through the air, then crashed to the\n",
        "floor, unable to see as debris rained upon him, his arms over his head. He heard\n",
        "Hermione's scream, Ron's yell, and a series of sickening metallic thuds which told him\n",
        "that Xenophilius had been blasted off his feet and fallen backward down the spiral stairs.\n",
        "Half buried in rubble, Harry tried to raise himself. He could barely breathe or see for dust.\n",
        "Half of the ceiling had fall in and the end of Luna's bead was hanging through the hole.\n",
        "The bust of Rowena Ravenclaw lay beside him with half its face missing fragments of\n",
        "torn parchment were floating through the air, and most of the printing press lay on its side,\n",
        "blocking the top of the staircase to the kitchen. Then another white shape moved close by,\n",
        "and Hermione, coated in dust like a second statue, pressed his finger to her lips.\n",
        "The door downstairs crashed open.\n",
        "\"Didn't I tell you there was no need to hurry, Travers?\" said a rough voice. \"Didn't I tell\n",
        "you this nutter was just raving as usual?\" There was a bang and a scream of pain from\n",
        "Xenophilius.\n",
        "\"No...no...upstairs...Potter!\"\n",
        "\"I told you last week Lovegood, we weren't coming back for anything less than some\n",
        "solid information! Remember last week? When you wanted to swap your daughter for\n",
        "that stupid bleeding headdress? And the week before\" -- Another bang, another squeal --\n",
        "\"When you thought we'd give her back if you offered us proof there are Cumple\" -- Bang\n",
        "-- \"Headed\"--bang--\"Snorkacks?\"\n",

        "\"And now it turns out you only called us here to try and blow us up!\" roared the Death\n",
        "Eater, and there was a volley of bangs interspersed with squeals of agony from\n",
        "Xenophilius.\n",
        "\"The place looks like it's about to fall in, Selwyn,\" said a cool second voice, echoing up\n",
        "the mangled staircase. \"The stairs are completely blocked. Could try clearing it? Might\n",

        "\"Homenum revelio.\" said the voice at the foot of the stairs. Harry heard Hermione gasp,\n",
        "and he had the odd sensation something was swooping low over him, immersing his body\n",
        "in its shadow.\n",
        "\"There's someone up there all right, Selwyn,\" said the second man sharply.\n",
        "\"It's Potter, I tell you, it's Potter!\" sobbed Xenophilius. \"Please...please...give me Luna,\n",

        "could, over all the wreckage to where he lay, trying to prise a heavy chest of drawers off\n",
        "his legs. While Xenophilius banging and scraping drew nearer and nearer, Hermione\n",

        "\"All right.\" breathed Hermione, as the broken printing press blocking the top of the stairs\n",

        "not leaves, but the sound of the Sea far-off; a sound he had never heard in \n",
        "waking life, though it had often troubled his dreams. Suddenly he found he \n",
        "was out in the open. There were no trees after all. He was on a dark heath, \n",
        "and there was a strange salt smell in the air. Looking up he saw before him \n",
        "a tall white tower, standing alone on a high ridge. A great desire came over \n",
        "him to climb the tower and see the Sea. He started to struggle up the ridge \n",

        "of its evil uses not of its good. The world is changing, you say. Minas \n",
        "Tirith will fall, if the Ring lasts. But why? Certainly, if the Ring were \n",

        "-Ring of Power. It is a gift, I say; a gift to the foes of Mordor. It is mad \n",

        "Boromir strode up and down, speaking ever more loudly: Almost he seemed \n",
        "to have forgotten Frodo, while his talk dwelt on walls and weapons, and the \n",
        "mustering of men; and he drew plans for great alliances and glorious \n",
        "victories to be; and he cast down Mordor, and became himself a mighty king, \n",
        "benevolent and wise. Suddenly he stopped and waved his arms. \n",

        "not. The only plan that is proposed to us is that a halfling should walk \n",
        "blindly into Mordor and offer the Enemy every chance of recapturing it for \n",
        "himself. Folly! \n",
        "\n",

        "'You misunderstand me,’ said Frodo. \n",
        "\n",
        "'But you will come, at least for a while? ' Boromir persisted. 'My city \n",
        "is not far now; and it is little further from there to Mordor than from \n",
        "here. We have been long in the wilderness, and you need news of what the \n",
        "Enemy is doing before you make a move. Come with me, Frodo,' he said. \n",
        "'You \n",
        "\n",
        "need rest before your venture, if go you must.’ He laid his hand on the \n",
        "hobbit's shoulder in friendly fashion; but Frodo felt the hand trembling \n",
        "with suppressed excitement. He stepped quickly away, and eyed with alarm the \n",
        "tall Man, nearly twice his height and many times his match in strength. \n",
        "\n",
        "'Why are you so unfriendly? ’ said Boromir. 'I am a true man, neither \n",
        "thief nor tracker. I need your Ring: that you know now; but I give you my \n",
        "word that I do not desire to keep it. Will you not at least let me make \n",
        "trial of my plan? Lend me the Ring! ’ \n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "mining our cause. If any mortals have claim to the Ring, it is the men of \n",

        "have been mine. It should be mine. Give it to me ! ' \n",
        "\n",
        "Frodo did not answer, but moved away till the great flat stone stood \n",
        "between them. 'Come, come, my friend! ' said Boromir in a softer voice. 'Why \n",
        "not get rid of it? Why not be free of your doubt and fear? You can lay the \n",
        "blame on me, if you will. You can say that I was too strong and took it by \n",
        "force. For I am too strong for you, halfling,' he cried; and suddenly he \n",
        "sprang over the stone and leaped at Frodo. His fair and pleasant face was \n",
        "hideously changed; a raging fire was in his eyes. \n",
        "\n",
        "Frodo dodged aside and again put the stone between them. There was only \n",
        "one thing he could do: trembling he pulled out the Ring upon its chain and \n",
        "quickly slipped it on his finger, even as Boromir sprang at him again. The \n",
        "Man gasped, stared for a moment amazed, and then ran wildly about, seeking \n",
        "here and there among the rocks and trees. \n",
        "\n",
        "'Miserable trickster!' he shouted. 'Let me get my hands on you! Now I \n",
        "see your mind. You will take the Ring to Sauron and sell us all. You have \n",
        "only waited your chance to leave us in the lurch. Curse you and all \n",
        "halflings to death and darkness ! ' Then, catching his foot on a stone, he \n",
        "fell sprawling and lay upon his face. For a while he was as still as if his \n",
        "own curse had struck him down; then suddenly he wept. \n",
        "\n",
        "He rose and passed his hand over his eyes, dashing away the tears. \n",
        "\n",
        "'What have I said? ' he cried. 'What have I done? Frodo, Frodo! ' he called. \n",
        "'Come back! A madness took me, but it has passed. Come back! ' \n",
        "\n",
        "There was no answer. Frodo did not even hear his cries. He was already \n",
        "far away, leaping blindly up the path to the hill-top. Terror and grief \n",
        "shook him, seeing in his thought the mad fierce face of Boromir, and his \n",
        "burning eyes. \n",
        "\n",
        "Soon he came out alone on the summit of Amon Hen, and halted, gasping \n",
        "for breath. He saw as through a mist a wide flat circle, paved with mighty \n",
        "flags, and surrounded with a crumbling battlement; and in the middle, set \n",
        "upon four carven pillars, was a high seat, reached by a stair of many steps. \n",
        "\n",
        "Up he went and sat upon the ancient chair, feeling like a lost child that \n",
        "had clambered upon the throne of mountain -kings. \n",
        "\n",
        "At first he could see little. He seemed to be in a world of mist in \n",
        "which there were only shadows: the Ring was upon him. Then here and there \n",
        "the mist gave way and he saw many visions: small and clear as if they were \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "under his eyes upon a table, and yet remote. There was no sound, only bright \n",
        "living images. The world seemed to have shrunk and fallen silent. He was \n",
        "sitting upon the Seat of Seeing, on Amon Hen, the Hill of the Eye of the Men \n",
        "of N®menor. Eastward he looked into wide uncharted lands, nameless plains, \n",
        "and forests unexplored. Northward he looked, and the Great River lay like a \n",
        "ribbon beneath him, and the Misty Mountains stood small and hard as broken \n",
        "teeth. Westward he looked and saw the broad pastures of Rohan; and Orthanc, \n",
        "the pinnacle of Isengard, like a black spike. Southward he looked, and below \n",
        "his very feet the Great River curled like a toppling wave and plunged over \n",
        "the falls of Rauros into a foaming pit; a glimmering rainbow played upon the \n",
        "fume. And Ethir Anduin he saw, the mighty delta of the River, and myriads of \n",
        "sea-birds whirling like a white dust in the sun, and beneath them a green \n",
        "and silver sea, rippling in endless lines. \n",
        "\n",
        "But everywhere he looked he saw the signs of war. The Misty Mountains \n",
        "were crawling like anthills: ores were issuing out of a thousand holes. \n",
        "\n",
        "Under the boughs of Mirkwood there was deadly strife of Elves and Men and \n",
        "fell beasts. The land of the Beornings was aflame; a cloud was over Moria; \n",
        "smoke rose on the borders of Lurien. \n",
        "\n",
        "Horsemen were galloping on the grass of Rohan; wolves poured from \n",
        "Isengard. From the havens of Harad ships of war put out to sea; and out of \n",
        "the East Men were moving endlessly: swordsmen, spearmen, bowmen upon \n",
        "horses, \n",
        "\n",
        "chariots of chieftains and laden wains. All the power of the Dark Lord was \n",
        "in motion. Then turning south again he beheld Minas Tirith. Far away it \n",
        "seemed, and beautiful: white-walled, many -towered, proud and fair upon its \n",
        "mountain- seat; its battlements glittered with steel, and its turrets were \n",
        "bright with many banners. Hope leaped in his heart. But against Minas Tirith \n",
        "was set another fortress, greater and more strong. Thither, eastward, \n",
        "unwilling his eye was drawn. It passed the ruined bridges of Osgiliath, the \n",
        "grinning gates of Minas Morgul. and the haunted Mountains, and it looked \n",
        "upon Gorgoroth, the valley of terror in the Land of Mordor. Darkness lay \n",
        "there under the Sun. Fire glowed amid the smoke. Mount Doom was burning, \n",
        "and \n",
        "\n",
        "a great reek rising. Then at last his gaze was held: wall upon wall, \n",
        "battlement upon battlement, black, immeasurably strong, mountain of iron, \n",
        "gate of steel, tower of adamant, he saw it: Barad-dyr, Fortress of Sauron. \n",
        "\n",
        "All hope left him. \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "And suddenly he felt the Eye. There was an eye in the Dark Tower that \n",
        "did not sleep. He knew that it had become aware of his gaze. A fierce eager \n",
        "will was there. It leaped towards him; almost like a finger he felt it, \n",
        "searching for him. Very soon it would nail him down, know just exactly where \n",
        "he was. Amon Lhaw it touched. It glanced upon Tol Brandir he threw himself \n",
        "from the seat, crouching, covering his head with his grey hood. \n",
        "\n",
        "He heard himself crying out: Never, never! Or was it: Verily I come, I \n",
        "come to you ? He could not tell. Then as a flash from some other point of \n",
        "power there came to his mind another thought: Take it off! Take it off! \n",
        "\n",
        "Fool, take it off! Take off the Ring! \n",

        "with one remaining instant in which to do so. He took the Ring off his \n",

        "either: whether we'll go along with him or no. He knows we mean to. That's \n",
        "another thing that's bothering him. If he screws himself up to go, he'll \n",

        "head in his hands, and sat as if bowed with grief. \n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "It was no good. They took no notice of him. Sam had dashed off first. \n",
        "Merry and Pippin had followed, and were already disappearing westward into \n",
        "the trees by the shore, shouting: Frodo! Frodo ! in their clear, high \n",
        "hobbit- voices. Legolas and Gimli were running. A sudden panic or madness \n",
        "seemed to have fallen on the Company. \n",
        "\n",

        "those two young hobbits, and guard them at the least, even if you cannot \n",
        "find Frodo. Come back to this spot, if you find him, or any traces of him. I \n",
        "shall return soon.' \n",

        "\n",
        "'Come with me, Sam! ’ he said. 'None of us should be alone. There is \n",
        "mischief about. I feel it. I am going to the top, to the Seat of Amon Hen, \n",
        "to see what may be seen. And look! It is as my heart guessed, Frodo went \n",
        "this way. Follow me, and keep your eyes open! ' He sped up the path. \n",
        "\n",
        "Sam did his best, but he could not keep up with Strider the Ranger, and \n",

        "your head! Let me see now! Boromir isn't lying, that's not his way; but he \n",
        "hasn't told us everything. Something scared Mr. Frodo badly. He screwed \n",
        "himself up to the point, sudden. He made up his mind at last to go. Where \n",
        "to? Off East. Not without Sam? Yes, without even his Sam. That's hard, cruel \n",
        "hard.' \n",
        "\n",
        "Sam passed his hand over his eyes, brushing away the tears. 'Steady, \n",

        "can't jump waterfalls. He's got no gear. So he's got to get back to the \n",
        "boats. Back to the boats! Back to the boats, Sam, like lightning! ' \n",
        "\n",
        "Sam turned and bolted back down the path. He fell and cut his knees. Up \n",
        "he got and ran on. He came to the edge of the lawn of Parth Galen by the \n",
        "shore, where the boats were drawn up out of the water. No one was there. \n",
        "There seemed to be cries in the woods behind, but he did not heed them. He \n",
        "stood gazing for a moment, stock-still, gaping. A boat was sliding down the \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "bank all by itself. With a shout Sam raced across the grass. The boat \n",

        "\n",
        "'Coming, Mr. Frodo! Coming! ' called Sam, and flung himself from the \n",
        "bank, clutching at the departing boat. He missed it by a yard. With a cry \n",
        "and a splash he fell face downward into deep swift water. Gurgling he went \n",
        "under, and the River closed over his curly head. \n",
        "\n",
        "An exclamation of dismay came from the empty boat. A paddle swirled and \n",
        "the boat put about. Frodo was just in time to grasp Sam by the hair as he \n",
        "came up, bubbling and struggling. Fear was staring in his round brown eyes. \n",
        "\n",
        "'Up you come, Sam my lad! ’ said Frodo. 'Now take my hand! ' \n",
        "\n",
        "'Save me, Mr. Frodo! ’ gasped Sam. 'I'm drownded. I can’t see your \n",
        "hand.’ \n",
        "\n",
        "'Here it is. Don't pinch, lad! I won’t let you go. Tread water and \n",

        "and let me use the paddle! ' \n",
        "\n",
        "With a few strokes Frodo brought the boat back to the bank, and Sam was \n",
        "able to scramble out, wet as a water-rat. Frodo took off the Ring and \n",
        "stepped ashore again. \n",
        "\n",
        "'Of all the confounded nuisances you are the worst, Sam! ’ he said. \n",
        "\n",
        "’Oh, Mr. Frodo, that’s hard! ’ said Sam shivering. 'That’s hard, trying \n",
        "to go without me and all. If I hadn’t a guessed right, where would you be \n",
        "now? ’ \n",
        "\n",
        "'Safely on my way.’ \n",
        "\n",
        "'Safely! ’ said Sam. 'All alone and without me to help you? I couldn’t \n",
        "have a borne it, it’d have been the death of me.’ \n",
        "\n",
        "’It would be the death of you to come with me, Sam,’ said Frodo and I \n",

        "with you.’ \n",
        "\n",
        "'Now, Sam,’ said Frodo, 'don’t hinder me! The others will be coming \n",
        "back at any minute. If they catch me here. I shall have to argue and \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "explain, and I shall never have the heart or the chance to get off. But I \n",
        "must go at once. It's the only way.’ \n",
        "\n",
        "'Of course it is,' answered Sam. 'But not alone. I'm coming too, or \n",
        "neither of us isn’t going. I'll knock holes in all the boats first.' \n",
        "\n",
        "Frodo actually laughed. A sudden warmth and gladness touched his heart. \n",
        "'Leave one! 'he said. 'We'll need it. But you can't come like this without \n",
        "your gear or food or anything.' \n",
        "\n",
        "'Just hold on a moment, and I'll get my stuff!' cried Sam eagerly. \n",
        "\n",
        "'It's all ready. I thought we should be off today.' He rushed to the camping \n",
        "place, fished out his pack from the pile where Frodo had laid it when he \n",
        "emptied the boat of his companions' goods grabbed a spare blanket, and some \n",
        "extra packages of food, and ran back. \n",
        "\n",
        "'So all my plan is spoilt! ’ said Frodo. 'It is no good trying to \n",
        "escape you. But I’m glad, Sam. I cannot tell you how glad. Come along! It is \n",
        "plain that we were meant to go together. We will go, and may the others find \n",
        "a safe road! Strider will look after them. I don't suppose we shall see them \n",
        "again.' \n",
        "\n",
        "'Yet we may, Mr Frodo. We may,' said Sam. \n",
        "\n",
        "So Frodo and Sam set off on the last stage of the Quest together. Frodo \n",
        "paddled away from the shore, and the River bore them swiftly away, down the \n",
        "western arm, and past the frowning cliffs of Tol Brandir. The roar of the \n",
        "great falls drew nearer. Even with such help as Sam could give, it was hard \n",
        "work to pass across the current at the southward end of the island and drive \n",
        "the boat eastward towards the far shore. \n",
        "\n",
        "At length they came to land again upon the southern slopes of Amon \n",
        "Lhaw. There they found a shelving shore, and they drew the boat out, high \n",
        "above the water, and hid it as well as they could behind a great boulder. \n",
        "\n",
        "Then shouldering their burdens, they set off, seeking a path that would \n",
        "bring them over the grey hills of the Emyn Muil, and down into the Land of \n",
